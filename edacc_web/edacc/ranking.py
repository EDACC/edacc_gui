    -------------

    This module implements some possible ranking schemes that can be used
    by the ranking view in the analysis module.

    The ranking view handler calls the function :rank_solvers: of this module,
    which has to accept the experiment of which the solver configurations should
    be ranked as parameter and return a list with the solver configurations
    ordered from best to worst.
